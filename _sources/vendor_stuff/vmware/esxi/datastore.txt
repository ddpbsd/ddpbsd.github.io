Don't fill the disk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ESXi needs space for swap, so don't fill it too much.
Not sure how much is the sweet spot though.

Snapshots are horrible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Snapshots take space.
Each iteration is a diff of the previous snapshot or base image I don't know.
So each one will take more and more space.
Snapshot, do stuff, verify it works, delete old snapshot.

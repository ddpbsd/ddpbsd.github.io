Password reset:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From their support forum: `here <https://supportforums.cisco.com/t5/small-business-switches/sg300-how-to-recovery-password-from-cli/m-p/2472157#M12022>`_

.. code-block:: console

   In order to reset the password from the boot menu you need to interrupt the boot process of the switch.
   Console in and power cycle the switch, you should see the Cisco logo, then you have about two seconds to hit a key to get the boot menu.
   If you miss it (or it times out once your in it) just power cycle the switch again to bring it up again.
   On the switch in front of me it is option 3 to reset the password.

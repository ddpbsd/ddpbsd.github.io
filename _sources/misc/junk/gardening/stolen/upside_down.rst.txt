   As with upside down tomatoes, add about a 2-inch (5 cm.) hole/opening in the bottom portion of the chosen container and use a coffee filter or newspaper to anchor your plant into place (add a slit for easy installation of the plant). Slowly and gently push your pepper plant through the hole so that it hangs out the bottom with the roots inside the container. You can then begin filling in around the plant roots with potting mix, tamping the soil as you go. Continue filling the container until you reach about an inch (2.5 cm.) or so from its rim. Water thoroughly until it drains out and then hang your inverted pepper plant in a sunny location.

   If you are using a bucket for growing tomatoes upside down, cut a hole about 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm.) in diameter in the bottom of the bucket.

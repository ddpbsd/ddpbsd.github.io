Tomato Tips
^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure you give the tomato plants something to grab onto.
The plants can get very tall, and a wooden dowel or cage helps keep it in check.
I use "cages" around the plants. They work, but put them on early.
They are horrible to put on when the plant has grown out of control.

Max # of docs in a shard is `Integer.MAX_VALUE - 128` What is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`?

Documents are kept in a buffer until it is flushed.

`refresh_interval` under `index/_settings` can be adjusted to flush more or less frequently.

.. code-block:: console

   PUT my_index/_settings
   {
     "refresh_interval": "30s"
   }


Wait for a lucene flush before the succeeded response goes back:

.. code-block:: console

   PUT my_index/_doc/102/?refresh=wait_for
   {
     stuff
   }


A shard is a collection of segments. Don't want too many segments.
Each segment is a fully independent index.
They are immutable, and can't be changed. Deleting them just marks them as deleted.


BKD trees

single and multi-dimensional numerics.


normalization factors
whoops, wasn't paying attention

doc_values
Every field has 2 inverted indexes! 1 for query, 1 for aggregation.


Segments can be merged.
This is an automated thing on the shard level.
merges will get rid of "deleted" segments.
6.5+ a single segment can be merged with itself.

Force merge API
Just in case you know better than elasticsearch/lucene

.. code-block:: console

   POST blogs/_forcemerge

Try not to do this. It seems like a bad idea to do it manually.

ES indexing
segments are fsync'd to disk during a lucene commit
transaction log tracks stuff that isn't written to disk.


Segments store: inverted index, list of fields, term frequency, proximity, field values, deletes, doc values,  and a bunch of other stuff

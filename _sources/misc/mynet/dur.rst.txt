`dur` is a raspberry pi zero 2W.


auto login
^^^^^^^^^^

For some reason rapberry pi OS is setup to auto login, but this is undesirable (of course).
There is a menu option to change it or it can be changed in `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf`.

wifi
^^^^

It has it, but my connections are super slow so far.

dur

`dur` is a raspberry pi zero 2W.


auto login
^^^^^^^^^^

For some reason rapberry pi OS is setup to auto login, but this is undesirable (of course).
There is a menu option to change it or it can be changed in `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf`.

wifi
^^^^

It has it, but my connections are super slow so far.

` Wifi lags ... <https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=348367 has some info.>`

* turn off PMF (Protected Management Frames) - not able to disable in my setup?
* turn off Band Steering - forces capable clients to 5ghz instead of 2.4 - was on, now off

Switching to a non-unifi device has made it much better.

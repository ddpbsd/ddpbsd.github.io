Pine64 Cluterboard
==================

I'm thinking about jotting down some notes on the pine64 `clusterboard <http://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PINE_A64-LTS/SOPine_Main_Page#Pine64_Cluster_Board_Resource>`_.

When I saw the `announcement <https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=5614>`_ my technolust kicked in. I had to have one. So I bought one.
It came with one SOPine module, and I figured I could purchase more when I figured that one out.
It arrived quicker than I thought it would.

.. Insert pictures of the equipment


At some point I will have to figure out the powersupply thing, using a flexATX powersupply looks like a better option in the long run.

Upgrade BIOS:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From Stuart Henderson on `misc@ <https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=156037126231372&w=2>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   If you're on an old BIOS revision for the APU (more than a couple of
   months old), try updating, they have enabled "core performance boost"
   which increases speed of a single core if the others are not under
   heavy load.

   I haven't done network benchmarks but there is a noticable improvement
   in some other things (md5 -tt goes from 12 -> 9 seconds).

   To update BIOS from OpenBSD, pkg_add flashrom and download the BIOS
   version for your board (https://pcengines.github.io/). Go to serial
   console and reboot in single-user mode (boot -s), mount -a, and run
   "flashrom --programmer internal -w apuX_vXXX.rom". Then reboot back
   as normal.

   If you'd like to compare benchmarks, the feature can be toggled
   from the setup menu in BIOS.

   Apologies I should have said: it should be power cycled at this point,
   not just a standard reboot.

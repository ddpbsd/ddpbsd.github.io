==================
arduino on openbsd
==================

I actually have NodeMCU devices. Hopefully this works with them too.
As soon as I find my hardware I can try to test.

Software Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adding the `avr` metapackage should load all the necessary packages.

All current understanding comes from `the playground <https://playground.arduino.cc/OpenBSD/CLI/>`_

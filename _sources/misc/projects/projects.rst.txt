Projects
========

Personal technology projects I try to spend time on.

OSSEC:
^^^^^^

`OSSEC <https://ossec.github.io>`_ is an open source 
Host Intrusion Detection systems. It does file integrity
monitoring, log decoding, alerting, and active response.

Current tasks:
  * Add libsodium support to get better file hashes. 

    * SHA256 support has been added, but not integrated.
      
    * blake2b would be nice

    * Still need to look at possible changes in `analysisd`

  * lua support in `rootcheck` would make it much more powerful.

  * Some kind of stats for `remoted` (number of msgs).

  * Some more stats for `analysisd`, or current stats in json.

  * Better `syscheckd` alerts. 

    * Different alerts for owner/perm/hash/etc?

  * Pledge?

  * `yara` in `rootcheck`?

  * `openscap`


OSSEC Documentation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

People who write documentation regularly are saints and deserve all
of the praise. *I need to get back into this.*


ESP8266:
^^^^^^^^

Ties into sensornet above. The goal is to make small and
inexpensive devices I can sprinkle throughout an area to 
collect environmental information. Temperature and humidity
are the first I want to monitor. Others may follow.

ARM:
^^^^

I have a small, but growing, group of ARM based systems.

`pine` is my DNS server. It's a pine64 A64+ running OpenBSD.

`clusterboard <../mynet/computers/pine64_clusterboard/index.html>`_
is a pine64 clusterboard with 7 modules. I'm playing with k3s on it,
but haven't gotten very far.

`espressobin` I haven't gotten this one working yet. After it blew up my
network, I put it off to the side.

`beaglebone black` Not currently in use, but I was thinking of putting it
to use with the esp8266 sensornet as the aggregator.

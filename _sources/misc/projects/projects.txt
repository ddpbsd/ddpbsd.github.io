Projects
========

Personal technology projects I try to spend time on.

OSSEC:
^^^^^^

`OSSEC <https://ossec.github.io>`_ is an open source 
Host Intrusion Detection systems. It does file integrity
monitoring, log decoding, alerting, and active response.

Current tasks:
  * Add libsodium support to get better file hashes. 
    SHA256 support has been added, but not integrated.

  * Pull the `analysisd` changes from Wazuh. the adjustable
    fields support would be nice.

  * lua support in `rootcheck` would make it much more powerful.

OSSEC Documentation:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

People who write documentation regularly are saints and deserve all
of the praise. *I need to get back into this.*

Sensornet:
^^^^^^^^^^

A centralized collection of environmental sensors.
Currently focuses on OpenBSD's sensors since `collectd`
and friends don't seem to support them. The sensors and
values are logged to graphite an viewed through grafana.
Might be switching to influxdb in the future.

I eventually plan on adding `esp8266` sensors to the mix.
I'd love to track temperature and humidity throughout my
home. Maybe moisture levels in the few plants I have.

MQTT?

ESP8266:
^^^^^^^^

Ties into sensornet above. The goal is to make small and
inexpensive devices I can sprinkle throughout an area to 
collect environmental information. Temperature and humidity
are the first I want to monitor. Others may follow.

ARM:
^^^^

I have a small, but growing, group of ARM based systems.

`pine` is my DNS server. It's a pine64 A64+ running OpenBSD.

`clusterboard` is a pine64 clusterboard with 4 modules. I'm hoping
to create a kubernetes cluster out of it to build a system to help
test OSSEc. This idea is in the very early stages though, so don't
ask me many questions about it (unless you're trying to help :)).

`espressobin` was going to be the head of my k8 cluster, but it seems
much more DIY than I was hoping for. Currently running Ubuntu, but it
seems flaky. I may find more reliable USB storage for the k8 cluster head
and use a clusterboard module, or invest in some network storage.

`beaglebone black` Not currently in use, but I was thinking of putting it
to use with the esp8266 sensornet as the aggregator.

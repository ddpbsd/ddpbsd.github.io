ask what a command does
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ask it what a command does and it will tell you what the parameters do.
You can give it the `--help` page or whatever for a better response.

I'm not sure how this is better than pulling up the `man` page and figuring it out.

ask how to do a thing with a command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tell CGPT what you want to do with a command, and it will tell you how to do that.

Again, read the docs and learn something?

parse unformatted data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Feed it random data and tell CGPT to format it nicely for you.

ThioJoe says "don't trust it with mission critical data" so why bother?

parse an error to make it nicer to read
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This might be helpful with the god awful elastic logs.

put data into a specific format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like turning a markdown table into a csv.

Really?

reverse dictionary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Describe a thing and have CGPT tell you what it is called.

You can upload a picture as well.

ask it what the fluffiest towel out there is
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I don't know how this is actually useful.

translate a word into many languages with a specific context
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Say `file` in the context of a computer file.
This one is pretty nifty, but ThioJoe says he wouldn't use it for mission critical stuff.

add comments to your code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Then recheck their comments.
wtf why is this thing allowed near my code?

add debug print statements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucking hell

calculate subscription break even point
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At what point is an unlimited plan worth it over a "pay as you go" type of plan.
ThioJoe used a wolfram alpha plugin to do the math because CGPT can't do math?

what ip range does a given ip fall into
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given an ip, find the range out of a list of ranges that the IP falls into.

CGPT apparently used python to do the stuff which ThioJoe could have done with python?


Hayls World
^^^^^^^^^^^

summarize an article or youtube video for you
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hot damn now I don't need to read or watch things.

How do I make sure it didn't hallucinate anything?

CGPT can teach you things by giving you guides on a topic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Not sure why this is better than tfm, but ok cool.

CGPT can do your homework for you
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wolfram Alpha did this previously, but now it's AI!

It can grade your homework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

yay?

doc-GPT?
^^^^^^^^

It can give you a detailed exercise plan for losing weight or builking up or whatever.
It can also do meal plans with calorie allowances and turn this into a shopping list.
It can also come up with a recipe if you give it some recipes, kind of like a bunch of other sites did back in the day.

analyze a message to make it write like you
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Give it some of your writing and it can copy the style.

After watching her ask it how to deal with a roommate that steals her bananas I closed the video.
Its answers were text book stuff.


Ok Jeff Su, help me out!

context cheating
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Steal data off of websites to give it to CGPT instead of understanding it yourself.

convert with intention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I'm too lazy to read things, so make CGPT give me a structured outline of a report.
You can make it customize the outline to a specific thing by specifying the purpose.
Like "outline this fashion report to help company X fight off companies Y and Z in this industry."


answer leveling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ask CGPT to give you different levels for your answers.
like level 1: email marketing, level 2: off-line event, level 3: gimme ideas based on l1&l2.

snmpwalk with v3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is all in reference to an OpenSNMPd implementation.

.. code-block:: console

   snmpwalk -v3 -l authPriv -u USER -a SHA-256 -A "AUTHKEY" -x AES -X "ENCKEY" TARGET

`-a` should align with the auth hmac encryption, just formatted
slightly differently.

`-A` will be the user's password, or `authkey`.

`-x` will be AES or DES (so AES).

`-X` will be the `enckey` from the config.

`TARGET` is the host to run this against.

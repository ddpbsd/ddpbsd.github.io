Installing it on windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installed python via the microsoft store, then `pip install pyinstaller`.
It worked, and put pyinstaller in:

.. code-block:: console

   C:\Users\danp\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.9_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python39\Scripts

Which isn't in my PATH or anything.
Lots of fun.

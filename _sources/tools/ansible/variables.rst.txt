Variables
^^^^^^^^^

In the playbook add `vars:` followed by the variables to be defined.
These can be `ansible-vault` encrypted strings.

.. warning:

   When creating the string, don't include the variable name.
   Just put the value.

.. code-block:: console

   ---
   - name: a sample playbook
     hosts: localhost
     become: yes
     remote_user: stevc

     vars:
       sample_variable: !vault |
              $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
              STUFF STUFF STUFF

     tasks:
       - do stuff


Other than using `group_vars`, I haven't figured out how to do playbook specific
vaults.
It's really annoying actually.

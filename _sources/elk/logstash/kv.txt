Key/Value pair blah blah


whitespace:
^^^^^^^^^^^

If you expect blank values, set whitespace to strict (if you are certain this won't break
everything).

Limitations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

It does not like spaces inside of a value. If a key is followed by
a space, the next key will be the value of the first key.

Message:

.. code-block:: console

   key1= key2=value

Becomes:

.. code-block:: console

   key => key2=value,

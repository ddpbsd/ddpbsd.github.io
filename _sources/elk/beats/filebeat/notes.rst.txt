added fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Filebeat appears to add some fields:

* `host` - Not sure if it's the beats host or what

* `source` - Log file that the messages are grabbed from

There may be more, but these are what I have so far.

filestream input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The filestream input requires the files to be greater than 1024 bytes in size to be read.
This can be a problem for testing.

Adjusting the `prospector` settings can make this easier, but `64` is the absolute minimum.
I believe the `offset` starts the read at that offset, but I could be mistaken.
I'm leaving it in because it's what I used and it worked for my uses.

.. code-block:: yaml

   - type: filestream
     id: logs
     paths:
       - /var/log/test.log
     enabled: true
     prospector:
       scanner:
         fingerprint:
           length: 64
           offset: 0

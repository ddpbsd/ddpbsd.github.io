Setting up the whole thing
==========================


Systems
^^^^^^^

I setup on 3 small VMs running CentOS 7.
2GB RAM each, 100GB data disk, smaller OS disk.

Since this is just in my lab, they're guests on the same VM host.

Updates were installed, linux was made usable (`tcpdump`, `tmux`, `ifconfig`, and
a number of other necessary packages were installed).

elasticsearch installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

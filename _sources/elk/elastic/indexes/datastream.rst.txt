decommission a data stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a data stream won't be used any longer but the old data needs
to be kept, it can be modified using the `modify_data_stream` api
to not have a write index anymore.
This prevents an empty data stream from sitting around taking up space
and valuable shards.

.. code-block:: console

   POST /_data_stream/_modify
   {
     "actions": [
       {
         "remove_backing_index": {
           "data_stream": "logs-xxx-default",
           "index": ".ds-logs-xxx-default-000002"
         }
       }
     ]
   }

Leave the ILM policy intact, so the old indices can continue through
their stages of life.

Index Lifecycle Management
==========================

I have some mental block with ILM.
So trying to get a grasp on it has been difficult.

This could all be wrong, and is definitely incomplete.

Basic steps
^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Create the Lifecycle policy

#. Create index template

#. Add the lifecycle policy to the template

#. Bootstrap the index

#. Rejoice?

There are probably a few steps missing, including a lot of cursing.

Index Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Do not include `aliases` information in the template.
  If the aliases section is populated it will cause errors about
  the alias pointing to multiple indexes.

* Include this information in the index template.
  This adds it to the lifecycle policy (can also be done in Kibana).

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "settings": {
       "index": {
         "lifecycle": {
           "name": "ILM_POLICY_NAME",
           "rollover_alias": "INDEX_ALIAS",


Index Bootstrap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Boostrap the index with the following settings:

.. code-block:: console

   PUT /INDEX_ALIAS-000001
   {
     "aliases": {
       "INDEX_ALIAS": {
         "is_write_index": true
       }
     },
     "settings": {
       "index": {
         "lifecycle": {
           "origination_date": TODAYS_DATE_IN_UNIX_EPOCH
         }
       }

     }
   }

The origination_date might not be necessary, but so far it is working.

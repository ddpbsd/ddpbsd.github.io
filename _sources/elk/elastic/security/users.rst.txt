logstash user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a user with the `logstash_writer` role for logstash.

.. code-block:: console

   POST /_security/user/logstash_internal
   {
     "password" : "x-pack-test-password",
     "roles" : [ "logstash_writer"],
     "full_name" : "Internal Logstash User"
   }


beats user
^^^^^^^^^^

I'm not sure what I was doing here.
These are probably notes about the roles required?

.. code-block:: console

   manage_index_templates
   monitor
   manage_ilm

.. code-block:: console

   indices: `*beat*`
   priviledges: write create delete create_index manage manage_ilm

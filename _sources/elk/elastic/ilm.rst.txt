Index Lifecycle Management
==========================

I have some mental block with ILM.
So trying to get a grasp on it has been difficult.

Basic steps
^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Create index template

#. Create the Lifecycle policy

#. Add the lifecycle policy to the template

#. Bootstrap the index

#. Rejoice?


Index creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Boostrap the index with the following settings:

.. code-block:: console

   {
     "aliases": {
       "INDEX_ALIAS": {
         "is_write_index": true
       }
     },
     "settings": {
       "index": {
         "lifecycle": {
           "origination_date": TODAYS_DATE_IN_UNIX_EPOC
         }
       }

     }
   }

I'm not entirely sure about the unix epoc thing, but it seems to work.

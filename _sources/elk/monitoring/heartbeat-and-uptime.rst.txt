====================
heartbeat and uptime
====================


heartbeat systemd service file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The service is `heartbeat-elastic.service` (instead of putting elastic first like they do for agent, they decided to put it after).

.. code-block:: console

   systemctl enable heartbeat-elastic.service
   systemctl start heartbeat-elastic.service

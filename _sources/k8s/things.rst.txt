There are a lot of things in k8s.
I have no idea what each one is yet.

The `k8s glossary <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/fundamental=true>`_ has a lot of things.


cluster
^^^^^^^

The collection of things that make the whole thing work.

node
^^^^

Individual machines (virtual or physical) where containerzed applications (things) can run.

   kubelet
   ^^^^^^^

   An agent that makes sure containers are running in a pod.

   kube-proxy
   ^^^^^^^^^^

   A network proxy to maintain network rules.

control plane
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Manages the worker nodes and pods.

   kube-apiserver
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


   etcd
   ^^^^


   kube-scheduler
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


   kube-controller-manager
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


   cloud-controller-manager
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


pods
^^^^

Represents a set of running containers.

stateful sets

Not sure WTF they are just yet, but I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to stop some things in k8s.
I really need to look for a glossary or something.

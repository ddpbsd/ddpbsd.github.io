`C4Labs <https://c4labs.com>`_ released a custom case for the 
`clusterboard <https://www.c4labs.com/product/presale-pine64-cluster-case-pine64-clusterboard-with-7-sopine-compute-module-slots/>`_.

It's very nice, but not perfect.
The instructions were decent, but use your brain. The pictures don't always match reality.

Issues
^^^^^^

* The screw pictures aren't correct.

* The heatsinks block access to the console pins.

* The holes above the USB ports are too small for the thumb drives I was using with the modules.


Awesome stuff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The fans are a nice touch. Very quiet.

* I didn't expect to receive the heatsinks, so they were nice.

* The CPU temps on my modules are much lower than they were.

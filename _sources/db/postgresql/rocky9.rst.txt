install

.. code-block:: console

   # dnf install postgresql-server

init
^^^^

Will initialize a db in `/var/lib/pgsql/data`

.. code-block:: console

   # postgresql-setup --initdb

Unfortunately it does a shitty job of dealing with passwords.

Put the super user password in a file and try:

.. code-block:: console

   env PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-A scram-sha-256 --pwfile=/PATH/TO/FILE" postgresql-setup --initdb

The `--pwprompt` option doesn't seem to work as this is a wrapper around `initdb(1)`.

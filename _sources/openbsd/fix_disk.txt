.. _openbsd_fix_disk::


I used my USB drive to install SecurityOnion and now it's all messed up.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I tried formatting it in Windows and adding the files I wanted to transfer, but the linux
boot stuff still showed up.

Formatting didn't help, fdisk didn't help. disklabl showed only the `c` partition as an ISO9660
partition, which could be mounted, but showed me the wrong stuff.

Using `disklabel` to change the `c` partition to unused did not help. Does `dd` help? YES!

.. code-block:: console

   # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sd4c

That seemed to help. I can now read my files! Yay me!

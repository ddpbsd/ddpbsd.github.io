.. code-block:: console

   sudo /usr/bin/unattended-upgrade


.. note::

   This will only use the ${dist}-security target. Most systems should have this installed and available.
   The default configuration is at: ``/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades``
   It is configured as a system service that runs automatically at shutdown.

Windows Credential Manager
==========================


Ever wanted to pretend you were part of a domain, but you aren't?
WCM seems to help with that I guess?

From `here <https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/66014/connect-to-sql-server-with-windows-authentication-in-a-different-domain>`_

Error message:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

   Login failed. The login is from an untrusted domain and cannot be used with Windows authentication.

Credential Manager to the rescue:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

   You can add the credentials to your profile in Windows using the Credential Manager found in the Windows control panel.

   Open Credential Manager
   Click "Add A Windows Credential"
   Populate the "internet or network address" field with the name and port number of the SQL instance you wish to store credentials for.

   Example: UniServer:1433 (1433 is the default port, you may need a different port, especially if you are connecting to a named instance)

   Populate the "User Name" (don't forget to include the domain e.g. MYDOMAIN\MYUSER)
   Populate the "Password"
   Click OK
   If you have the server name, port and login details correct, you should now be able to use Windows Authentication from most client tools, SSMS, Excel, whatever. They will all use the stored credentials.

   Tip: Sometimes you need to use the FQN for the server when adding the credentials. e.g. UniServer.UniDomain.org:1433, it all depends on your network specifics.

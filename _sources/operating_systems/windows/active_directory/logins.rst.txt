Account getting locked out randomly?
Try this.

In powershell, find the domain controller with the `PDC emulator` role.
This is the one to check on.

Then filter for event id 4740 in Event Viewer on that system in the Security section.
Filter as necesary, find the user (Find on the right).

Look at events and find the `Caller Computer Name` field in the General tab.

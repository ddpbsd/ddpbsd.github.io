Linux has removed a bunch of useful commands.
=============================================

Where is netstat?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's now `ss`. Goot luck. I still don't know how to do `-pan`.

.. code-block:: console

   ss -l4n


This gives more than I usually want, but it seems to give me more open ports than the above command.

.. code-block:: console

   sudo ss -tulpn

ifconfig is broken?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No, they just don't install it.
Use `ip` instead. Good luck.

.. code-block:: console

   ip addr

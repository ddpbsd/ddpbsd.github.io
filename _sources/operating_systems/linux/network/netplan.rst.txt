Netplan
=======

All of the other network configuration systems 
weren't good enough, so a new one was created.
I imagine it's not very good either, but it uses
YAML. So yay?

Renderers:
^^^^^^^^^^

netplan can configure `systemd-networkd` or `NetworkManager`
but I have no idea which one to use on my system at the moment.
I'm guessing `networkd` (which is the same as `systemd-networkd`?),
because I don't see `NetworkManager` in my `dpkg --list` output.

I kind of miss being able to configure a system 
through simple configuration files. Configuration
files for programs that write configuration files 
for processes to configure the network seems a bit
silly. *shrug*

I must not do anything complicated enough to see
the value in this.


netplan generate:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It doesn't really do anything until you have 
netplan setup. Why's it on the front page before
the explanation of how to make the yaml files I'll
never know.

.. code-block:: console

   netplan generate

netplan apply:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This segfaults. But it did delete my interface somehow?
I'll reboot and see if it helps.

.. code-block:: console

   netplan apply

Basic example:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I'm praying this works, but I'm not holding my breath.

.. code-block:: yaml

   network:
     version: 2
     renderer: networkd
     ethernets:
       enp3s0:
         addresses:
           - 10.10.10.2/24
         gateway4: 10.10.10.1
         nameservers:
             search: [mydomain, otherdomain]
             addresses: [10.10.10.1, 1.1.1.1]

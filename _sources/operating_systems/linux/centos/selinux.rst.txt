Allow ssh keys for auth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For some reason `authorized_keys` isn't installed in the correct context.
So make sure it's in the right context so it can work. Don't be fooled
by key auth working under `/usr/sbin/sshd -ddd`, it's a lie.

.. code-block:: console

   restorecon -R ~/.ssh

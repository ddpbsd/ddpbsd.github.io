mount: unknown filesystem type 'vfat'
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The vfat kernel module isn't getting loaded.
Possibly because of the CIS benchmarks.
This can be a problem for EFI systems (mounting `/boot/efi` isn't possible without `vfat`).

Somewhere in (on RHEL based systems) `/etc/modprobe.d` vfat is getting blocked.
Look for a line like: `install vfat /bin/true` in one of the files.
Replace that line with just `vfat` and all should be well.

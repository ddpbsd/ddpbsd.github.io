oh god it gets worse

In `nft` there are tables, chains, and rules (and probably other stuff, fml).
Each piece can be operated on.

list all rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I think this lists everything.

.. code-block:: console

   nft list ruleset

list rules in a table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

   nft list table firewalld

Unless there is an address family.
There can be a `firewalld` table for each address family.
Address families include (but are not limited to) ip (ipv4), ip6 (ipv6), inet (ipv4 and ipv6), etc.

.. code-block:: console

   nft list table inet firewalld

list rules in a chain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

   nft --handle list chain inet firewalld filter_FWDO_FedoraServer

adding rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^

`firewalld` is the table, `filter_IN_public_allow` is the chain.

.. code-block:: console

   nft add rule inet firewalld filter_IN_public_allow tcp dport 8080 accept

deleting rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deleting rules requires a handle as well as the table, chain, and possibly address family.
The handle is a number for the rule, starting from 0.
This seems to start from the beginning of the ruleset (I think).
Don't count though, there's a command to get the handles.
I think the `--handle` should just be default.

Get the handle:

.. code-block:: console

   nft --handle list table inet firewalld

Delete the rule:

.. code-block:: console

   nft delete rule inet firewalld filter_IN_FedoraServer_allow handle 65

Of course the `Arch Wiki <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/nftables>`_ has useful information on `nft`.

The nft wiki `Simple Rule Management <https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Simple_rule_management>`_ page is anything but simple.

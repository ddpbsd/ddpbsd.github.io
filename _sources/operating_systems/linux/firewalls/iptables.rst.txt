iptables
========

Save the current iptables ruleset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   I've done this on an appliancized Debian 8.4.
   No clue where else it may work.

This saves the currently running ruleset to a file that can then be modified,
and loaded as below.

.. code-block:: console

   iptables-save > FILE

Load a ruleset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

   iptables-restore FILE

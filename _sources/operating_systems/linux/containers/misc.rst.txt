see processes in different namespaces

context for rocky stuff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While playing with rootless containers I ran into context issues.
The files that were being mounted in a container needed to be:
`system_u:system_r:container_file_t:s0`, but that's not what was
presented in the logs.

rootless user namespaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`The podman docs <https://docs.podman.io/en/v4.6.0/markdown/options/userns.container.html>`_

`/etc/subuid` contains info on sub uids for each user.
The format is `USERNAME:first uid:last uid` (it might actually be the
uids between those numbers, non-inclusive(but that seems confusing)).

There is also an `/etc/subgid` that does the same thing for groups.

When running with podman you can use
`--userns keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000` to map the user account (running
podman?) to uid and gid (in this case) `1000` inside the container.
So this makes sure files owned by `uid 1000` outside of the container
would be owned by `uid 1000` inside the container.

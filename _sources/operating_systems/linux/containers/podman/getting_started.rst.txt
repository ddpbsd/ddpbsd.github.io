network
^^^^^^^

By default podman creates a bridge names `podman`.
View the available networks with `podman network ls` and see the details for a network with `podman network inspect NETWORK_NAME`.

I don't see a way to inspect the bridge with system level tools (like `brctl`, `ifconfig`, or `ip`).
To restrict the containers to a specific interface (in a multi-homed system), I think the `macvlan` or `ipvlan` options would be necessary.
As of the time I'm writing this, macvlanand ipvlan don't support `port forwarding <https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-network-create.1.html>`_.
I'm not entirely sure how that affects my uses yet.

pods
^^^^

Creating and using `pods`_ is simple:

.. code-block:: console

   $ podman pod create PODNAME
   $ podman run --pod PODNAME -it docker.io/library/busybox

More can be added to the pod creation to limit resources.

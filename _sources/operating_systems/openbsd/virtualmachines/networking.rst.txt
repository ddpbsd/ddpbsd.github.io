Networking
==========

The OpenBSD `FAQ entry <http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html#VMMnet>`_
has some information, but I need more.

`This <http://blog.hermes-technology.de/openbsd/server/virtualmachine/network/2017/06/12/vmd-for-a-virtual-server-network.html>`_
has more information as well.

Use a `veb(4)` to do bridged networking.

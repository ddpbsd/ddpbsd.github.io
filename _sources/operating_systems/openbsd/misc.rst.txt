Find unlinked files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command will find open file descriptors that belong to unlinked files.
(In case a program has a file open, but that file is deleted.)

.. code-block:: console

   fstat | grep -F '* -'

memory and swap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From otto:
.. code-block:: console

   Yes, a physical memory shortage in the past can lead to swapped out
   pages. Pages remain in swap if the pages are untouched since then,
   even after the memory shortage is gone. You can look for processes
   that have a large virtual size (SIZE column in top) but much less
   memory in the resident set (RES column in top).
